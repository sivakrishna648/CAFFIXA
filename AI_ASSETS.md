## 🎞️ 4K Cinematic Video Prompt
Use this in tools like **Runway Gen-3**, **Luma Dream Machine**, or **Kling AI**.

**Prompt:**
> "Cinematic 4K ultra-realistic footage of rich, dark coffee pouring smoothly into a handcrafted matte black ceramic cup. Captured in extreme slow motion, showing the mesmerizing liquid swirl and a delicate surface splash as it hits the bottom. Wisps of soft, natural steam rise gracefully in 3D space, catching soft warm amber lighting. The background is a moody, dark-themed luxury café with blurred mahogany textures and golden bokeh. High-end depth of field, sharp macro focus on the golden-brown crema and individual micro-bubbles. Advertising-grade production quality, elegant, sophisticated, and appetizing."
